This is a flutter project, I make it for fun and to help new
developers understand flutter concepts and beauty ❣️❣️ 

If you download the project, 

the structure is simple: 

        /lib/project_name/main.dart 

        to run a specific project use
        
// run this in vscode terminal, Hope you have everything set up. like flutter sdk, and so on...
// if not, first do it. there are thousands of tutorials on youtube to help you on that 

flutter run -d <enter your Platform> --target lib/project_name/main.dart

<this will run the specific project you choose>

feel free to play with the source code for learning purposes. 

and you reach me for more help:
